      <h2>S: Week 3. Making it wilder</h2>
<img src="/img/blog/2012-10-06_01.png" />
<p>During this week I decided to go back to the drawing board for a couple of days. There were some parts of the project that felt like they were simply lacking aim. To fix that, the computer was turned off, delicious cups of coffee were brewed, and enjoyed while writing down my thoughts. It was a nice break from the modeling, coding and the other computer related tasks. The latter part of the week, once an oversight was gained, was spent on testing out modifying the original models to get slightly more surreal game world than the prototype had and to see how those changes affect the overall atmosphere and immersion.</p>

<p>On the left side of that image you will see the original prototype, Susannah, from 2009. Showcasing the beginning of the game world where the player finds it/him/herself. In contrast is the current version of the same area in S.</p>

<p>Gone is the eerie silent and sterile perfection, and the only thing remaining are the remnants of that once sterile world.
The towers are angled and unstable, the pathways are breaking apart and barely floating in the air, and the floor is bent and angled like the wooden floor of a house that has been abandoned for half a century. That world is falling apart, and the habitant is getting desperate.</p>
