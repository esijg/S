<p>I have reached the point where screenshots don't really do <strong>S</strong> its justice anymore as the visuals are near non-existant at this point but the audio is gaining ground. This week has seen work on the implementation of what I would consider the most fun mechanic of this interactive world. The creation of sound.</p>

<p>Right now it is quite bare bones but it can simply be described as a basic sampler, although positioned in 3D space. This allows the performer to position sound objects in the world to create the preferred soundscape. Distance from objects controls volume obviously and size of object controls pitch.</p>

<p>Next step is to give the performer more control over the sounds either by procedural audio generation or real time effects.</p>
